                The Mixtape Collective is a collaborative website that brings individuals together through 
                a mutual appreciation of music. 
                
                Users contribute by submitting a mixtape, that expresses their personal tastes, usually crafted 
                around a certain mood,theme or idea. The Mixtape is then added to the Library where it 
                becomes accessible for other users. 

                The MixTape Collective reconfigures the way we discover music. It does so by reimagining the 
                process of creating and receiving mixtapes on a digital platform. What makes a mixtape better 
                then sharing a playlist is that the person who made it had to hand write the song titles and 
                artists or make their own artwork. It’s personal. It’s genuine. Unlike vinyl records, cassette 
                tapes absolutely do not sound better then digital. They sound tiny and have a low hiss in the 
                background and will start to warble if you listen to the same tape over and over too many 
                times. Mixtapes fit into that beautiful in-between for price and art. They give users the ability to
                craft a fully realized piece of art.

                We are now living in an era where streamed digital music has taken over. It has freed us from 
                the inconvenience of the physical medium. But in many ways, the algorithms that 
                streaming platforms use have started to take over the act of music discovery. Between Spotify, 
                YouTube and Apple Music, it’s possible to not only find virtually any song, but be fed the 
                “perfect” song for your tastes and mood.

                What’s The Point podcast ep. “Are Algorithms Ruining How We Discover Music?”, has Ben 
                Ratcliff discussing his new book “Every Song Ever”, where he explains his thoughts
                on streaming platforms.  

                <i>  “I do feel pessimistic about the whole project. I do feel that if the great push 
                    of the smartest minds in this business is moving towards efficiency in curating for you, in 
                    delivering you what it knows you will like from the great abundance, well, 
                    something’s being lost, isn’t it? Isn’t the thing that’s being lost you and your efforts
                    to figure out what you like and you respond to?”</i>

                Listening to music as a creative act.
                
                <i>  “Listening to music is a really creative act. It’s not just passive. Listening to music is
                    one of the things that helps you discover your humanity. Through listening to music you
                    learn how to walk and talk and move and have relationships and speak different languages. You pick
                    up things from music that really increase your humanity. Music is mysterious. And I don’t 
                    want robots completely in control of my sense of discovery.”</i>

                By participating in this collective, users are encouraged to be creative. Listening to music is a 
                creative act, and as such, makes the process of creating a mixtape a form of self-reflection. 
                Self-reflection and discovery come together to create a wholesome experience, that brings us 
                together – during a time when we feel most separated.

                To create a MixTape simply select and add 5 songs
                into the collaborative Google doc <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-1M5Fq70rKU62MM41IskX1hD1JpJyeejtxO8HRXaujw/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.

                Your MixTape can be based on a certain mood or theme, 
                or it can be a random selection of your favourite tracks.
